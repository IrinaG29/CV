## About Me

I am a recent Makers Academy graduate, having previously migrated from the field of cognitive neuroscience. Working closely with software engineers to methodically collect and analyse data to improve algorithms to detect dementia in patients was hugely satisfying. This made me realise how much I would love to be part of the development process.

After finishing my intensive 4 month bootcamp I started my career as a software engineer by volunteering for Now-u. This gave me the opportunity to apply my newly acquired knowledge and strengthen my skills.

## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Final project**            | A webapp to do x. | React, Jest, etc. |
| **Something else worked on** | A webapp to do y. | Ruby              |

## Skills

#### Communication and patience
- While doing clinical research on people with different types and stages of dementia, I would have to listen and understand their needs, explain concepts to many levels and repeat myself as many times as necessary during each consultation.
- At Makers, I had the chance to refine my communication skills through daily pair programming by planning and executing tasks with my pair partners.

#### Efficiency with attention to detail
- As a research assistant I had to analyse data from video recordings by counting and labelling every gesture produced by patients with subtypes of PPA (Primary Progressive Aphasia).
- As an anti-fraud analyst I had to spot patterns in the e-commerce orders in order to detect fraudulent behaviour and risky orders. After 1 year, I became the head of the anti-fraud team.
- Attention to detail is also extremely important when debugging code, which we did daily during the Makers course.

#### Knowledge hungry
- Currently going through the “Agile Web Development with Rails 6” book in order to expand my programming skills by building a website.
- In my first week at Makers, I didn’t stop until I found the explanation to a very unusual error. Turns out whitespace is an argument separator in Ruby.

## Experience

**Rails, React developer - Now-U, volunteering** (March 2021 - Present)
- Collaborating with other volunteers in the planning and developing of the website. Through collaboration I was able to solve multiple blockers thus improving workflow.
- Agile working, writing, amending and refactoring code.
- Attention to detail while implementing various features and fixes is vital.

**Research Assistant - Neurosciences Research Centre, Molecular and Clinical Sciences Research Institute, St. George’s University of London** (August 2019 - July 2020)
#### Research 1:
- Collecting data on patients for the development of a speech based app that can detect and monitor the risk factor of cognitive decline at early stages.
- The app aimed to automatically detect language patterns indicative of cognitive decline by employing AI and Machine Learning techniques.
- Data was collected during the Principal Investigator’s and specialist nurse clinics.
#### Research 2:
- Analysing data from video recordings to detect changes in co-verbal gesture production and body language in patients with subtypes of - Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA): Semantic dementia (SD), Progressive non fluent aphasia (PNFA) and Logopenic aphasia (LPA).
